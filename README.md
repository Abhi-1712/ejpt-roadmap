# Ejpt Roadmap

The eJPT preparation roadmap can help you prepare for the exam in 2 months. The following study plan is based on eJPT study material, TryHackMe rooms (some rooms might require a voucher), and additional reading materials. I have assumed that during the preparation, one will commit 8-10 hours of daily study for 2 months. Note-taking is quite important, so make sure to take full advantage of note-taking apps of your liking. To learn about my study approach and the tools I used to improve my preparation, go through my eJPT exam experience blog below.
